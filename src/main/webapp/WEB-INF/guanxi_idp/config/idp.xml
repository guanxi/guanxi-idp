  <!-- idp.xml
       This is the main configuration file for the IdP. You'll find comments for
       all the options but a good way to see what it's all about if you're just
       starting out is to delete the files:

       WEB-INF/keystore/guanxi_idp.jks
       WEB-INF/keystore/guanxi_idp_cert.txt

       and run the setup servlet. Of course, don't do this if you've already set
       up your identity and creds and they're working fine!

       If you create your own identity and creds sets you should change the names
       from genericIdentity and genericCreds as these are overwritten every
       time the above files are deleted and the setup servlet is run.

       for setting the SSO cooke.

  <!-- For each federation that the IdP is in, it may have to identify itself
       differently and also use different certificates to sign assertions.
       <service-provider> lets you map the IdP to federation requirements.
       Each <service-provider> element specifies the requirements of a Shibboleth
       compatible Service Provider.

       name
       You should set this to the providerId of the service provider that this
       IdP will be talking to.

       identity
       If the IdP has to identity itself differently depending on a Service
       Provider's requirements, you should create a new <identity> set and
       put it's name in here.

       creds
       These are the signing credentials of the IdP. If the IdP has to use
       certain certificates when signing assertions for a specific Service
       Provider then you should create a new <creds> set and put it's name
       in here.
  -->
  <service-provider name="EXAMPLE_SP_PROVIDER_ID" identity="exampleIdentity" creds="exampleCreds"/>

  <!-- This SP points to the default identity and creds to use -->
  <service-provider name="DEFAULT" identity="exampleIdentity" creds="exampleCreds"/>

  <!-- An identity set tells the IdP how to identity itself in assertions when
       talking to a Service Provider.

       name
       Choose a meaningful name for the identity set, so you know what it's for
       in future as you'll be using this in a <service-provider> description.
       e.g. "AthensShibbGateway"

       <issuer>
       You should put the URN of the IdP in here

       <name-qualified>
       You should put the name qualifier of the IdP in here. Usually this is the
       same as the <issuer>
  -->
  <identity name="exampleIdentity">
    <issuer>CREATED FROM SETUP</issuer>
    <name-qualifier>CREATED FROM SETUP</name-qualifier>
    <format>urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified</format>
  </identity>

  <!-- A creds (short for credentials) set tells the IdP what certificates to use
       when signing assertions to be sent to a Service Provider.

       name
       Choose a meaningful name for the creds set, so you know what it's for
       in future as you'll be using this in a <service-provider> description.
       e.g. "SDSSCredentials"

       <keystore-type>
       The type of java keystore you're using to hold your certificates.
       e.g. jks

       <keystore-file>
       The fully qualified path to your java keystore.
       e.g. /WWW/guanxi/WEB-INF/keystore/guanxi_idp.jks

       <keystore-password>
       The password for your java keystore

       <private-key-alias>
       The alias for your private key in your java keystore. This is the key
       that the IdP will use to sign assertions.

       <private-key-password>
       The password for your private key in the java keystore.

       <certificate-alias>
       The alias of the certificate in the keystore that holds your public key.
       This will be sent with signed assertions.

       <key-type>
       The type of your private/public keypair. Currently only dsa and rsa are
       supported.
       e.g. dsa

  <creds name="exampleCreds">
